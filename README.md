ZCE-guide is a small project that provides step by step guide on information needed to pass PHP5.3 ZCE certification: [http://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/php-5-certification/](http://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/php-5-certification/).

Also, it is a good place to start your experience with PHP5.3 or, if you are already an experienced web developer, to return to the basics and remember some details.

Project uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) (blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby) with some staff from [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) and is hosted with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).
