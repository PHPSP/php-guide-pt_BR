## What?

Originally PHP Study Guide was a small project that provides step by step guide on information needed to pass PHP5.3 ZCE certification: [http://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/php-5-certification/](http://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/php-5-certification/).

For now it aims to go little bit beyond the Zend Certification and is a good place to start your experience with PHP5.3 or, if you are already an experienced web developer, to return to the basics and remember some details.

## Where?

At the moment project is placed at <http://zce.evercodelab.com/> and hosted on [GitHub.Pages](http://pages.github.com).

## Sources

All content is assembled from different sources and tutorials.

* Zend PHP 5.0 Certification Course by Paul Reinheimer
* Zend PHP 5 Certification Study Guide
* Zend PHP 5.3 Study Guide v1
* [Read The Web Blog](http://readtheweb.info/index.php?s=Zend+PHP+5+Certification+Exam&submit=Go)
* <http://www.php.net/manual/en/>
* <http://zend-php.appspot.com/>

Original guide was structured in Google Docs and then published as [pdf](http://victimofbabylon.com/zce-php-53-study-guide).

## Who?

Mainly project is done by me, [Roma Lapin](https://github.com/memphys) and supported by [Evercode Lab](http://www.evercodelab.com/).

## Project layout and details

On the whole project follows standart [jekyll project layout](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/usage).

Each certification section is presented as page in `pages` directory. Each subsection is a part of a page.

Pygments is used for code highlighting.

Each page should have following variables in YAML Front Matter:

* title â€“ page title
* layout - usually it is "page"

Menus is stored in `_includes/menu`.
