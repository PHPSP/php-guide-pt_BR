The PHP source bundle comes with around 86 extensions, having an average of about 30 functions each. Do the math, that's about 2500 functions. As if this weren't enough, [the PECL repository](http://pecl.php.net/) offers over 100 additional extensions, and even more can be found elsewhere on the Internet.
